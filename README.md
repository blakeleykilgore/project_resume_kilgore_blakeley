###Resources:
* http://plnkr.co/edit/H0Rr0wTYYsTHZLuD3DPN?p=preview for creating the "Scroll Down" button and applying stops to each section on click.
* https://jsfiddle.net/4oL2p351/4/ for applying a hover to only on li, not the entire ul.

###jQuery Plugins:
* http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/#getting-started for the tool tips that appear when hovering over the portfolio links in the footer of the page.
* https://github.com/louisameline/tooltipster-follower for making the tooltip follow the mouse when hovering the footer portfolio links.
* http://jotson.github.io/jquery-colorstrip/ for the color strips used beneath the nav and above the footer.

###I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

###Comments:
The main issue I had with this assignment had to do with the animation for the header that I ended up not being able to use. I originally had clouds that were animated with CSS, but I could not figure out how to contain them inside of the header section. They ended up overlapping the nav menu and the links were not clickable. Therefore, I chose to go without them.
